                    It boasts a considerable charge capacity, and has a very aesthetically distinct look, as you can see, which will obviously help it stand out from other commercial freight vehicles on the road.
                    The Tesla Semi will go 0 to 60 mph in just 5 seconds, which is incredibly fast compared to a diesel truck.
                    It can go 0 to 60 mph towing 80,000 lbs, its max tow load, in just 20 seconds.
                    It can go 65 mph up a 5 percent grade, which is way better than the 45 mph max that a diesel competitor can do.
                    And for range, it can go 500 miles at highway speed, and less than 80 percent trips are at 250 miles.
                    It also has a better drag coefficient than a super car thanks to its extremely aerodynamic design.
                    The real secret weapon of the truck, however, isn’t that it can turn into a giant fighting robot (this feature hasn’t been activated yet, if it does exist, and Tesla won’t admit that it does).
                    Instead, it’s that the truck offers a transmission that requires no shifting of gears (as is normal for fully electric vehicles) with regenerative braking that provides “basically infinite” brake life per Tesla.
                    Tesla also says that the Semi outperforms its diesel rivals in terms of responsiveness and handling, and can cover more miles than a diesel semi truck in the same timespan, with safer operation in and around regular traffic.
                    It also uses a number of Model 3 components to maximize production efficiencies, including individual Model 3 motors for each wheel, and even Model 3 inset door handles.
                    What’s the big deal about an electric semi truck? It’s a fair question, especially given the range of traditional Diesel engine heavy-duty trucks.
                    These can have ranges of up to nearly 900 miles on a single tank.
                    But the long-term advantages of electric trucks could make a lot of sense, both from a relatively obvious ecological perspective, which is obvious, and from the perspective of cost-effectiveness.
                    Tesla will probably still face a lot of challenges in terms of both getting this truck built at scale, and encouraging broad adoption.
                    But it’s sticking to its playbook of looking at an industry where the legacy players have done something one way for a long time with relatively little in the way of innovation, and changing things drastically.
                    The question is whether applying this model will continue to work in its favor.
                    With a million mile warranty against any breakdowns on every truck, Tesla is doing its best to convince people that change is a good thing.
